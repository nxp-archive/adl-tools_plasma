<p><strong>Plasma</strong>, (<strong>P</strong>arallel <strong>LA</strong>nguage for <strong>S</strong>ystem
   <strong>M</strong>odelling and <strong>A</strong>nalysis) is a parallel language for system
   modeling and multithreaded application development implemented as a superset
   of C++.  The language extensions are based upon those found in <a href="http://www.wotug.org/occam/" class="http">Occam</a>, which is based upon CSP
   (Communicating Sequential Processes) by C. A. R. Hoare.  The basic idea is
   that threads are explicitly created by the user and they communicate using
   typed channels.  Plasma adds several additional concepts such as shared data
   structures protected by mutual-exclusion code and the ability to easily wait
   on the result of a function launched as a separate thread.  Although C++ is a
   difficult language from which to extract formal properties, we believe that
   the combination of CSP (which does have well-understood semantics) and an
   identified subset of Plasma will make this possible.</p><p>A PDF version of this document may be found at:</p><p><a href="http://www.somerset.sps.mot.com/projects/tools/plasma/index.pdf" class="http">http://www.somerset.sps.mot.com/projects/tools/plasma/index.pdf</a></p><!-- Purpose of This Work -->

<p>The goal of the Plasma project is to investigate whether a language with
      the appropriate constructs might be used to ease the task of system
      modeling by providing a simple means of representing systems models,
      increase productivity through clearer representation, and increase
      productivity and quality through increased compile-time checking of
      the more difficult-to-get-right aspects of systems models (the
      concurrency).  In addition to all of this, a language with built-in
      parallelism would mean that it could be used for actual application
      development and not just modeling.</p><p>The ability to enhance single-thread performance, such as by
      increasing clock frequency, is rapidly diminishing: power is becoming a
      dominating factor and limiting scalability.  Adding additional cores is a
      scalable way to increase performance, but it requires that customers of
      our parts have a method for developing multi-threaded applications.  A
      Plasma compiler would allow customers to develop such programs and do so
      in a safer manner by providing various compile-time checks for obvious
      problems.</p><p>A full-blown Plasma system would thus have wide applicability: It
      could be used by Freescale design teams to model proposed products and
      perform early architectural and microarchitectural design trade-offs.  In
      addition, customers could use the product to model their own complete
      systems, performing their own analysis to determine what should run as
      software on microprocessors and what should be dedicated hardware.  The
      portions of the Plasma code which would be implemented as hardware could
      then serve either as executable specifications or could be synthesized
      directly into hardware.</p><p>The use of Plasma will make it easier for us to develop products which
      meet our customers' performance needs, while also meeting their power
      requirements, by adding extra processor cores rather than developing
      brand-new cores.  For example, an engine controller consisting of just a
      single thread might need a new core, at twice the performance of the
      original, to handle an engine twice the size, thus running into severe
      power-budget constraints.  On the other hand, the same program implemented
      in Plasma, where each cylinder is implemented as a separate thread, could
      simply be run on a system consisting of two cores.</p></div><br>

<p>There exist a plethora of languages attempting to solve the problem of
      how to model complex systems.  They generally fall into two main
      categories: Those originally derived from a hardware description language
      and those derived from C or C++.  The first approach, typified by <a href="http://www.eda.org/sv/SystemVerilog_3.1a.pdf" class="http">System Verilog</a>, does allow the user to
      raise the level of abstraction, but it still remains primarily a language
      for describing hardware at a relatively low level.  For example, it has
      relatively limited abilities for creating new abstract data structures.
      It appears unlikely that we could convince customers to develop their
      software using this language.</p><p>The other approach, deriving a language from C or C++, is typified by
      <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~specc/" class="http">SpecC</a>, <a href="http://www.celoxica.com/methodology/handelc.asp" class="http">Handel C</a>, and
      <a href="http://systemc.org" class="http">SystemC</a>.  The first two are
      languages with true parallelism: Their compiles are able to perform safety
      checks to guard against common concurrency problems.  However, they are
      primarily aimed at describing hardware, though in a manner familiar to
      many programmers.  This means that they tend to implement a subset of C or
      provide constructs which are very specific to certain types of hardware
      modeling.  In addition, the fact that they are based upon C means that
      they are limited in their extensibility, versus the abstraction mechanisms
      offered by C++.</p><p>SystemC is not a true language in and of itself, but is a class
      library built on top of C++.  Since it implements parallelism, which is
      not provided by C++, it can in some ways be thought of as its own
      language, in so far as a traditional library is usually thought of as
      building upon existing facilities of a language.  Since SystemC builds
      upon C++, it does offer powerful abstraction mechanisms and the ability to
      use and create sophisticated data structures.</p><p>Its main problem, however, is that the compiler is unaware of the
      concurrency, and is thus unable to perform any relevant checks or
      optimizations.  In addition, the way in which concurrency and channel
      communication is implemented in SystemC requires the use of C++'s object
      system.  While this is not bad in principle, it would be nice to have the
      ability to write a concurrent program in an imperative, C-like fashion for
      those more comfortable with that style.  In addition, communication
      between threads, via channels, requires the use of virtual functions.
      Taken together, these restrictions mean that SystemC is unlikely to be
      used for actual application development.  However, it does show the
      utility of taking a powerful and extensible general purpose language and
      adding a modeling framework on top of it.</p><p>The Panama modeling environment, based upon SystemC and developed by
      FIL, has shown that SystemC can be used to do microarchitectural trade-off
      analysis.  The view adopted by Panama, that a system can be modeled as a
      collection of objects, each specialized to the system element to be
      modeled, and each given behavior through a script, is a promising
      beginning. The idea here is that a skilled modeling technology team
      creates the base objects, and folk in the product teams can personalize
      the behavior of the objects simply by writing scripts. This approach has
      the promise that the task of modeling can be distributed, and that a tools
      group can provide re-usable technology for use where needed. This approach
      has many advantages over the approach currently in effect in what was
      Somerset, that the modeling group provides both the technology and a modeling
      service.  Such a service-based approach is efficient in throughput- modelers
      are always busy, but not in latency- no more modelers can be provided, and
      so the time that a project must wait before it can have a model constructed can
      be lengthy, unpredictable, and uncontrollable.</p><p>However, even Panama's approach can likely be improved upon: One area is its
      choice of specialized objects and a rather limited scripting
      language. Rather than having many different object types, each of which is
      scriptable, we could have exactly one object, call it a <em>Processor</em>,
      capable of executing scripts written in a more general-purpose scripting
      language. Couple this improvement with the understanding that a key new
      ability we need is to model software at multiple levels of abstraction,
      and the idea behind Plasma becomes clear.</p></div><br>

<p>The novel aspect of this work is that Plasma is suitable for use as
      both an applications development language and as a modeling language.  For
      application development, both in the embedded and desktop/server realm, it
      provides a convenient means for exploiting parallelism provided by a
      multi-core hardware platform.  For modeling purposes, the parallelism in
      the language is used to model the parallelism inherent in the design being
      modeled.  In either case, a production-ready compiler for Plasma will know
      about this parallelism and be able to create better optimized code than
      the traditional approach of using a threading library.</p><p>For instance, on an explicit thread switch, the compiler need only
      generate code to save the live registers of the current function, rather
      than the entire hardware context.  In some cases, the matter is not just
      about optimization, but about actual correctness: An optimizer might think
      that a variable is dead, when in fact it is still being used by another
      thread.  Useful safety checks might also be made.  For example, the
      compiler can ensure that two different threads do not write to the same
      variable unless it is protected by mutual-exclusion code.</p><p>Another goal of Plasma is to add to C++ features that make it easier
      to create robust, correct programs.  C++ already offers good abstraction
      mechanisms and strong type-checking.  However, it lacks, for instance,
      garbage collection.  The current Plasma implementation adds garbage
      collection via the <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/" class="http">Boehm Weiser
      Garbage Collector</a>, a fully-conservative collector.  The interface allows
      the user to work with explicitly-managed memory or with managed memory,
      thus allowing for interoperability with existing C++ code.</p><p>In a production-worthy version of Plasma we hope to further
      investigate what else could be added in order to make life easier for the
      programmer.  For example, we might add default initialization of built-in
      types so that there is no chance of dangling pointers.  We might also
      consider the recommendations found within <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/c++94/full_papers/ellis.a" class="http">Safe, Efficient Garbage Collection for C++</a>.</p><!-- Parallelism -->

<p>Plasma inherits its parallelism constructs from Occam and extends
	 them with a functional operator, similar to the <em>future</em> found in
	 <a href="http://computing-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/MultiLisp" class="http">Multilisp</a>.  For

</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table><p>The functions <code>a()</code> and <code>b()</code> will run in parallel
	 but will both finish before function <code>c()</code> is called.  Each
	 statement within a <code>par</code> block is launched as a separate thread and
	 braces may be used to group multiple statements together.</p><p>A replicated form of <code>par</code> exists in the form of the <code>pfor</code> block:</p><table cellspacing="0" class="color" cellpadding="0"><tbody>

	 call to function <code>foo()</code>, is launched as a new thread <code>Max</code> times.</p><p>To work with a more functional approach, the <code>spawn</code>

</pre>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table></td></tr>

	    hardware-optimized intrinsics, if available.  The standard library

	    an interface channel for using the <code>Result</code> object returned
	    by a spawn function.</p><p>For example, the following code creates two threads, a producer

</tbody></table><p>The first thread writes numbers to a channel, while the second
	    thread reads from this channel and prints them using <code>mprintf</code>, a mutex-protected version of <code>printf</code>.
	    Flow-control is handled by the channel itself: If there is no data,
	    then a read will block, while if there is already a data item in the
	    channel, a write will block.</p><p>Calling <code>get()</code> works when only one channel needs to be
	    queried, but the situation often arises when multiple channels
	    exist.  A thread needs to block only if no data exists on any of the

</tbody></table><p>If none of the channels (<code>c0</code> through <code>c3</code>) have
	    any data, then the thread will suspend until data is available on
	    any one of the channels.  At that point, the relevant block of code
	    will be executed.  If one or more of the channels already has data
	    upon entry to the <code>alt</code>, then exactly one of the ready
	    channels will be read and its code executed; the selection of the

<p>The Plasma standard library contains a special kind of channel,

	    is a standard channel in the sense that it is just a templated class

	    producer writes integers to a channel while the consumer reads them,
	    stopping when a -1 is received.  Notice that neither function deals
	    with time explicitly; they simply communicate via a channel.  Only
	    the main function knows about time because it instantiates a clocked
	    channel, <code>IntChan</code>, and specifies that the period of the

	    size via a constructor parameter.  The behavior remains essentially
	    the same:  Writes never block unless the queue is full, which might

<p>Plasma contains a discrete-event time model for simulation
	 purposes.  This is not part of the language, per se, but is implemented
	 as a set of functions which manipulate the back-end thread package.
	 This means that a Plasma implementation designed for applications might
	 not support the time model, while an implementation designed for
	 modeling would.</p><p>A thread may delay itself by calling <code>pDelay</code> and may
	 consume time by calling <code>pBusy</code>.  A delay corresponds to a
	 thread waiting for some event to occur; it is not consuming any
	 resources and other threads may execute during this time.  Being busy,
	 on the other hand, means that the thread is working, or consuming the
	 processing resources of what it is running on.  These two functions are
	 the only way in which time advances in Plasma: Everything else is
	 considered to occur in zero time.</p><p>What this means is that a user may write real software for an
	 embedded application in Plasma.  To gain an understanding of the
	 software's resource requirements, it may be annotated with <code>pDelay</code> and <code>pBusy</code> calls based upon the anticipated behavior
	 of the underlying hardware.  For instance, a multiply-accumulate loop
	 might require two separate instructions, so a call to <code>pBusy</code>
	 with a value of two would be made.  However, this value could be
	 changed in order to understand the effects of adding a specific
	 multiply-accumulate instruction.</p><p>Threads may be distributed to multiple &quot;processors&quot; in order to model multiple
	 hardware resources in a simulation.  A thread on one processor might be
	 busy, but this does not affect a thread on another processor:</p><table cellspacing="0" class="color" cellpadding="0"><tbody>

</tbody></table></td></tr>
</tbody></table><p>Processors have their own private ready queues of threads, by
	 default, but can be instantiated such that several processors share a
	 single queue.  This allows for SMP systems to be easily modeled.</p><p>Each thread may be given a priority.  Higher priority threads (a
	 lower number) execute until completion before lower priority threads.
	 The lowest priority threads are time-sliced.  A delayed high-priority
	 thread may interrupt a lower-priority thread which is <em>busy</em>.</p></div>

<p>Plasma supports power modeling by providing some simple hooks for
	 recording and retrieving energy consumption on a per-processor basis.
	 The model calls <code>pEnergy(energy_t)</code> to add to the current processor's
	 consumed-energy value, where <code>energy_t</code> is currently defined as
	 a <code>double</code>.  Calling <code>pGetEnergy(Processor)</code> retrieves
	 a processor's consumed energy and clears the value.  Thus, to monitor
	 power, a thread might regularly query processors for their energy and
	 then divide this by the sample period.</p><p>Just as with evaluating compute requirements, a process of
	 step-wise refinement may be applied: The user might start with a very
	 course-grained analysis using average power values, then proceed to
	 refine that by adding different energy consumption statements for
	 different paths through the code or compute energy by looking at the
	 hamming distance between consecutive data values read from a channel.
	 Additionally, a model might wrap all calls to <code>pEnergy</code> so that
	 a scaling value, based on clock-frequency, might be applied.</p></div>
