	* Added a parallel quicksort to the regression.

	* Fixed parser bug:  You can't make a pointer to a reference, so
	if we use a reference within a par block, we don't take a pointer
	to it- we just keep treating it as a reference.

	* Fixed problem with pAbort() and pExit():  They now immediately
	switch to the scheduler, which sees that a shutdown is requested
	and thus exits.

	* Plasma project should now build and pass its regression.
