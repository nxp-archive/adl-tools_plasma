	* Started a user guide (doc/user-guide.rst) and a schedule
	(doc/schedule.rst).  The idea is that the schedule will be updated
	in advance and the user guide will be updated before a feature is
	committed.

	* Modified the implementation of pfor:  Instead of allocating
	space for the argument structure on the heap, I added a new
	version of pSpawn which allocates space on the stack structure,
	then copies data to this space.

	* Added support for the "pfor" construct.  Originally, this was to
	be called "par" too, but OpenC++ does not allow the same keyword
	to be used for multiple constructs.

	The usage is:

		pfor (<for-style condition>) {
		  <body>
		}

	<body> is launched as a thread for each iteration of the loop.
	Execution waits at the end of the loop until all threads
	complete.  A pfor loop currently requires that there be at least
	one declaration in the condition of the loop, e.g.

		pfor (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i) { ... }

	The reason for this is that anything declared in the loop
	condition is passed by value to the thread, while everything else
	is passed by reference in order to allow for side effects.
	Without the pass-by-value, the loop would complete (most likely)
	before any thread got scheduled, so every thread would see the
	same final value for the loop variable, rather than the value with
	which the thread was launched.  This seemed the best way to get
	around that undesirable behavior.

	* Added a parallel quicksort to the regression.

	* Fixed parser bug:  You can't make a pointer to a reference, so
	if we use a reference within a par block, we don't take a pointer
	to it- we just keep treating it as a reference.

	* Fixed problem with pAbort() and pExit():  They now immediately
	switch to the scheduler, which sees that a shutdown is requested
	and thus exits.

	* Plasma project should now build and pass its regression.

	*  Start of the plasma project.
