Plasma:  Parallel LAnguage for System Modelling and Analysis
============================================================

Plasma is a superset of C++, adding parallel extensions similar
to that provided by the language Occam.

Needed Packages on GAIN
-----------------------

To build:

  gnu-gcc-3.4.3-binutils-2.15 or gnu-gcc-3.4.1-binutils-2.15

To reconfigure, you will need:

  gnu-autoconf-2.59
  perl-5.8

For documentation:

	tetex-2.0.2
    inria-skribe-/1.2b

To Build From CVS:
------------------

./autogen.sh <options>

   	This runs autoconf and automake, then runs configure.  After it's done,
	run make.

	You need automake 1.9.2 and autoconf 2.59 for this to work.

	You can also just run ./configure, as described below.

To Build From A Distribution:
-----------------------------

./configure <options>

   The most common option is "--prefix=<dir>", which specifies the
   target directory.  You may need to modify your PATH or supply other
   options so that configure is able to find the programs it needs, such
   as gcc 3.x and OpenC++.

   OpenC++ is a C++ parser and meta-object protocol framework.  It is available
   from here:  

	http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/openc++.html  

   It has been installed in _TOOLS_ on GAIN as the package opencxx-bk-

   Note:  You can't just use the distributed version due to some necessary extensions
   and bug fixes.  Instead, you have to use a special version that's installed
   on GAIN and stored in CVS at /nfs/ibmoto/tools/CVS_root/opencxx-bk

make
 
   This builds the system.

make check

   This runs the regression.

make install

   This installs the program.
