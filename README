Plasma:  Parallel LAnguage for System Modelling and Analysis
============================================================

Plasma is a superset of C++, adding parallel extensions similar
to that provided by the language Occam.

Needed Packages on GAIN
-----------------------

To build:

  gnu-gcc-3.4.3-binutils-2.15 or gnu-gcc-3.4.1-binutils-2.15

To reconfigure, you will need:

  gnu-autoconf-2.59
  perl-5.8

For documentation:

	tetex-2.0.2
    inria-skribe-/1.2b

To Build From CVS:
------------------

./autogen.sh <options>

   	This runs autoconf and automake, then runs configure.  After it's done,
	run make.

	You need automake 1.9.2 and autoconf 2.59 for this to work.

	You can also just run ./configure, as described below.  However, you will
	need to configure with "--enable-maintainer-mode" or run autogen.sh in
	order to modify any Makefile.am.  This will, of course, require automake.

To Build From A Distribution:
-----------------------------

./configure <options>

   The most common option is "--prefix=<dir>", which specifies the
   target directory.  You may need to modify your PATH or supply other
   options so that configure is able to find the programs it needs, such
   as gcc 3.4.

make
 
   This builds the system.

make check

   This runs the regression.

make install

   This installs the program.
